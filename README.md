# Tablut Game Project

This is a school project I created based on the classic game **Tablut**, implemented using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It serves as a modern interpretation of this historical board game.

## Features
- An interactive game board with a responsive design.
- Gameplay mechanics that replicate the traditional rules of Tablut.
- A clean and user-friendly interface for an enjoyable experience.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project folder and double-click the `index.html` file.
3. The game will launch in your default web browser.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML** for structuring the layout.
- **CSS** for styling and visual design.
- **JavaScript** for game logic and interactivity.

## Acknowledgments
This project was inspired by **Tablut**, a well-known variant of the ancient **TÃ¡fl** games.
